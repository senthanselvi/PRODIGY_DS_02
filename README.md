1. Dataset Source: Downloaded the Titanic dataset from Kaggle here.
2. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed relationships between variables, explored distributions, and identified key trends using Python and Pandas.
4. Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that illustrate insights gained from the dataset.
